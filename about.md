# About 

I am currently enrolled in a 3-year engineering course at **IMT Atlantique**, in Brest, FR, in apprenticeship with **Orange Wholesale France**, in Lyon, FR. During my last 6 months at school, I decided to follow **Mathematical and Computational Engineering (MCE)** courses. 

Inside those MCE courses, I chose the ***Image*** specialization. I thus have notions in **Computational Imaging** and **Computer Vision**, that my little repositories might show a bit. I worked on several projects most of them were research papers implementations (LSSC for example).

I am very interested in all the Image field (Computational Imaging, Computer Vision, Image Processing, ML/DL applied to Images), and I am looking for an opportunity in September 2020 in Lyon, FR.
