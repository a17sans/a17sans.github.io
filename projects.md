## Projects

### Academic projects

#### Numerical methods applied to hyperspectral images (**Julia**)

> Given spatial satellite images of a certain landscape, and a *dictionnary* of soil elements (ground, sand, grass), we applied gradient descent to get at each point the composition of the soil (as a linear combination of the *basis* given as dictionnary). This rather classic numerical method algorithm for minimization problem.

#### Enveloppe detection for white light microscopic interferometry (**Python**)

> Given a set of pictures taken at different heights, the intensity of each pixel describes a cosine modulated by an exponential enveloppe. All of the process was about implementing mathematical models to get the maximum of the intensity, this is, finding the maximum of the enveloppe.

### Personal projects

#### Consumer habits modelling (**Python**)

> I am currently trying to build a machine learning model, based on my bank transactions to see whether there are regularities at the scale of a year for example. This is only research, and has no real purpose but to be aware of it (hopefully before advisers).

#### Accountability tool (**Python**)

> I built a very simple tool (UI) using PyQT to help with basic accountability operations : store transactions in database (SQLite), make totals, and give statistics. This tool was a need for friends of mine. This is one example among many of little projects that I build to help my relatives.

#### Applications (**Android**)

> I also build little applications in my spare time, to help people around me as well.
