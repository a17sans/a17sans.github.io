# About 

<div style="text-align: justify">
I am currently enrolled in a 3-year engineering course at <b>IMT Atlantique</b>, in Brest, FR, in apprenticeship with <b>Orange Wholesale France</b>, in Lyon, FR. During my last 6 months at school, I decided to follow <b>Mathematical and Computational Engineering (MCE)</b> courses.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Inside those MCE courses, I chose the <i><b>Image</b></i> specialization. I thus have notions in <b>Computational Imaging</b> and <b>Computer Vision</b>, that my little repositories might show a bit. I worked on several projects most of them were research papers implementations (LSSC for example).

<div style="text-align: justify">
I am very interested in all the Image field (Computational Imaging, Computer Vision, Image Processing, ML/DL applied to Images), and I am looking for an opportunity in September 2020 in Lyon, FR.
